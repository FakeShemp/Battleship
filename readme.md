# Battleship

### Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* pygame 1.9x (`python3 -m pip install pygame`)

### Playing the game
* Run with `python3 battleship.py`
* The game starts with placing the ships on the grid. **Drag** the ships to where 
you want them with the mouse. **RMB** rotates the ship. Click the **green button** at the 
bottom when you're ready.

a **black block** is a miss. First one to hit all the opponent's targets wins.
